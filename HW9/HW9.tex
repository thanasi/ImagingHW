\section{Problem 1}
\textbf{Suppose that you have an image that consists of $256\times256$ square pixels of size 0.8mm.  Obtain the spatial sampling frequency and the Nyquist frequency. Does the maximum frequency change if the image size is $512\times512$ while the pixel size is the same?}\\

The spatial sampling frequency is $$f_s=\frac{1 \text{ sample}}{.08\,\text{mm}} = 12.5\,\text{mm}^{-1}.$$
The corresponding Nyquist frequency, symbolizing the spatial frequency of the smallest resolvable detail, is $$f_N=\frac{f_s}{2} = 6.25\,\text{mm}^{-1}.$$

If the image size is increased to $512\times512\text{pix}^2$, but the pixel size remains the same, then the Nyquist frequency also remains the same, since there is no change in the number of samples per unit real space.
