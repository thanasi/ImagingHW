\begin{document}
The file that contains the function definitions for these examples, \texttt{ball.py}, is listed in the appendix.  The specific script used to produce the output for each problem are listed with problem itself.  All images are scaled to $64\times64$\texttt{px} for viewing purposes.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1-1} comprises the three $32\times32$ binary images created.  Each image was made using the \texttt{make\_ball()} function with different parameters passed to it. The parameters are tabulated in Table \ref{table:1-1}.\\
\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& Figure \ref{fig:1-1a} & Figure \ref{fig:1-1b} & Figure \ref{fig:1-1c} \\

\caption{Program Parameters}
\label{table:1-1}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:1-1a} shows the isodistance contour produced when using "city block" distance as the metric ($D_4$) .  Figure \ref{fig:1-1b}shows a contour with produced using the Euclidean metric ($D_E$), and with a shifted center.  Figure \ref{fig:1-1c} demonstrates the isodistance contour created when using the "chessboard" distance metric ($D_8$) , over a range of distances and with a shifted center.\\

The isodistance contours take on very different shapes depending on the metric used and the radius chosen.  With the Euclidian metric, it forms a discrete circular ring.  Using the 4-connectivity metric, the contour depicts a diamond.  With the 8-connectivity metric, it is a square.
When the radius is small enough, however $(r<3)$, then $D_4$ and $D_E$ provide give the same locus of points. 

If the background contiguity is determined by 8-connectivity, then the $D_8$ metric is the only metric that can be used to create a single equidistant contour that separates the background into two non-contiguous regions.  However, if such a contour is made over a range of distances, ($2\leq d<r$) then all three metrics separate the background into two non-contiguous regions.

\subfloat[$D_4$]{\label{fig:1-2b}\includegraphics[width=64px]{1-2b.png}}\hfill

\label{1-2}
\end{figure}
The images in Figure \ref{1-2} are distance maps created using the different metrics, calculated as distance from the center.  Darker shades represent smaller distances, and lighter shades represent larger distances.  Figure \ref{fig:1-2a} was created using the Euclidean metric. Figure \ref{fig:1-2b} was created using the "city block" metric.  Figure \ref{fig:1-2c} was created using the "chessboard" metric.

\caption{Circular Region}
\label{fig:1-2d}
\end{figure} 

The region in Figure \ref{fig:1-2d} was created using the distance map, Figure \ref{fig:1-2a}, binarizing the image using the threshold radius, $r=10$. The region corresponds to the run-length code in \texttt{out2.txt}.

\section{Problem 3}

\subfloat[Read Image]{\label{fig:1-3a}\includegraphics[width=64px]{1-3a.png}}\hfill

\label{1-3}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:1-3a} displays the decoded input from the run-length code in Problem 2, \ref{fig:1-3b} the image with the sampling grid and \ref{fig:1-3c}, the $8\times8$ re-sampled ball.  The output quad tree code is displayed in \texttt{out3.txt}.  The quad tree code was encoded from top left across the row, and then down through the columns.

\section{Problem 4}
To demonstrate its capability, I had \texttt{problem4.py} use \texttt{int2bin()} to convert the digits from 0 to 16 into binary.  As an added feature, I had it pad them so they are all 4 digit binary strings.  The output is listed below:

\section{Appendix: Common Code}
Common functions used for these problems are contained in \texttt{ball.py}.  Note that \texttt{**} denotes raising to a power, and "numpy" (np) is a library which adds mathematical and matrix functionality similar to what is default in Matlab and IDL.
